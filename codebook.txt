finalcast.txt contains 180 observations of 81 variables.

Each observation corresponds to a unique combination of subject and activity. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, yielding 180 observations.

The first two variables are subject and activity.  Column 1 indicates subject number, and Column 2 indicates activity, using a plain English label.

The remaining variables are averages across the given subject-activity combination.  The original data set consists of more than 10,000 observations, meaning that each subject had multiple observations for each activity. finalcast.txt averages these observations.

The original data set contains 561 values that are captured in each measurement. finalcast.txt depicts information about only 79 of these values specifically those that correspond to the mean and standard deviation of each feature.  For example, there are 40 values associated with tbodyAcc in the original data set, but only 6 of those observations pertain to the mean and standard deviation of tbodyAcc.  Only these 6 are included in finacast.txt

The complete list of included values follows below.
